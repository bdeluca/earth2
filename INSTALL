= Installation instructions for Earth 0.2 =

=== Download Earth ===

[https://open.rsp.com.au/earth/releases/earth-0.2.tar.gz Download version 0.2 of Earth]

Untar the distribution and move to the root directory of the distribution
{{{
tar zxvf earth-0.2.tar.gz
cd earth-0.2
}}}

=== Dependencies ===

Earth is built using the language [http://www.ruby-lang.org Ruby],  the Ruby code coverage tool [http://eigenclass.org/hiki.rb?rcov rcov], the web development framework [http://www.rubyonrails.org/ Ruby on Rails], and the database [http://www.postgresql.org/ Postgres]. If you don't have these installed [wiki:InstallDependencies follow these instructions].
 
=== Create Earth database ===

Create three databases "earth_production", "earth_test" and "earth_development" which are accessible by the user "earth", with the password "earth". If you need help with this see [CreatingEarthDatabases these instructions].

=== Migrate the database ===

{{{
rake db:migrate
}}}

=== Run the unit tests (optional) ===

For a good deal of confidence that everything is set up correctly and working, run the unit tests. It's as simple as:
{{{
rake
}}}

=== Start Earth daemon ===

{{{
./script/earthd start
}}}

=== Choose a directory to watch ===

The first time you use Earth, pick a directory to watch that is small and doesn't have too many files. That way it won't take too long for the daemon to do the initial indexing of its contents.

{{{
./script/earthd add directory_to_watch
}}}

=== Monitoring the daemon ===

Depending on the size of the directory to be watched, the daemon will take a while to index the directory. Then after that, it will quickly see changes.

To see the status of the daemon
{{{
./script/earthd status
}}}

=== Start web application ===
The simplest way to get started is to use "Webrick" the default web server that comes with Rails.
{{{
./script/server
}}}

=== Use the Earth web application ===
Point your browser at [http://localhost:3000] and you're using Earth!
