	  shows the issues.

2007-02-28  Bruno Mattarollo  <bruno.mattarollo@rsp.com.au>

	* test/unit/file_monitor_test.rb: One commit worst than the other.
	  Now I had removed the sorting. ARGH.

2007-02-28  Bruno Mattarollo  <bruno.mattarollo@rsp.com.au>

	* test/unit/file_monitor_test.rb: Duh! My last commit was
	  completely useless. I didn't change the part where I compare
	  against what I get from the DB. Little kludge for now.

2007-02-28  Bruno Mattarollo  <bruno.mattarollo@rsp.com.au>

	* test/unit/file_monitor_test.rb: Sorting the directories as
	  received from the DB call Directory.find by their path in an
	  array and using that to compare to what we built in the array.
	  This works on Mac OS X, need to commit to test on Linux

2007-02-28  Matthew Landauer  <matthew@visualappliance.com>

	* app/models/earth/directory.rb, daemon/file_monitor.rb: Extracted
	  method from file_monitor that belonged in Directory class. Now,
	  all caching code is in directory where it belongs. Also, inlined
	  method in file_monitor

2007-02-28  Matthew Landauer  <matthew@visualappliance.com>

	* app/models/earth/cached_size.rb, daemon/file_monitor.rb: More
	  size refactoring. Inlined method

2007-02-28  Matthew Landauer  <matthew@visualappliance.com>

	* app/controllers/browser_controller.rb,

	  app/views/servers/show.rhtml, test/unit/server_test.rb: More size
	  refactoring. Removed three methods from Server model

2007-02-28  Matthew Landauer  <matthew@visualappliance.com>

2007-02-28  Matthew Landauer  <matthew@visualappliance.com>

	* app/models/earth/cached_size.rb, app/models/earth/directory.rb,
	  app/models/earth/file.rb, app/models/size.rb: Using new Size
	  class instead of bytes, blocks and count

2007-02-28  Bruno Mattarollo  <bruno.mattarollo@rsp.com.au>

	* test/unit/file_monitor_test.rb: Commented it out so that it
	  doesn't break other people's stuff

2007-02-28  Bruno Mattarollo  <bruno.mattarollo@rsp.com.au>

	* test/unit/file_monitor_test.rb: Some debugging code to test this
	  on a Linux box

2007-02-28  Bruno Mattarollo  <bruno.mattarollo@rsp.com.au>

	* test/unit/file_monitor_test.rb: Using Kernel.rand instead of
	  issuing a 'dd'.
	  
	  This resolves the "slowwwwww" performance of dd if=/dev/random on
	  Linux.

2007-02-28  Bruno Mattarollo  <bruno.mattarollo@rsp.com.au>

	* test/unit/file_monitor_test.rb: 1st attempt at changing the 'dd'
	  that's used in the test to using Kernel.rand to gain performance
	  on this under Linux

2007-02-28  Matthew Landauer  <matthew@visualappliance.com>

	* app/models/earth/directory.rb: Inlined method

2007-02-28  Matthew Landauer  <matthew@visualappliance.com>

	* app/models/earth/directory.rb: Now caches bytes, blocks and count
	  at the same time. More room for refactoring

	  reversing migrations. Now can happily migrate between any version
	  without any problem.

2007-02-27  Matthew Landauer  <matthew@visualappliance.com>

	* db/migrate/035_create_filters_and_cached_sizes_table.rb,
	  db/migrate/042_replace_demo_filters.rb,
	  db/migrate/048_ensure_only_default_filter.rb: Using ActiveRecord
	  in migrations is problematic. Changes in models can break old
	  migrations. That's what happened here. Replaced use of models
	  with hand written sql. Fixes ticket #151

2007-02-27  Bruno Mattarollo  <bruno.mattarollo@rsp.com.au>

	* Rakefile: Wrapped the require for CI::Reporter so that it doesn't
	  become mandatory.

2007-02-27  Bruno Mattarollo  <bruno.mattarollo@rsp.com.au>

	* Rakefile: Adding dependency on CI:Reporter, a continuous
	  integration
	  gem. I am testing it so it will certainly break something.
	  Sorry :-(

2007-02-27  Matthew Landauer  <matthew@visualappliance.com>

	* app/controllers/graph_controller.rb, app/helpers/graph_helper.rb,

2007-02-27  Matthew Landauer  <matthew@visualappliance.com>

	* test/fixtures/filters.yml,
	  test/functional/graph_controller_test.rb: The IDE Radrails is
	  giving me trouble. The last commit broke the unit tests (when run
	  on the commandline) but they passed fine under Radrails. Radrails
	  seems to have issues about the unit test environment it sets up.

2007-02-27  Matthew Landauer  <matthew@visualappliance.com>

	  db/migrate/050_remove_filter_table.rb, test/fixtures/filters.yml,
	  test/functional/graph_controller_test.rb,
	  test/unit/file_monitor_test.rb: Now only caches items with the
	  default filter (no filtering). This allows us to get rid of the
	  Filters table and class. Next cached_sizes gets moved into the
	  directory class

2007-02-26  Matthew Landauer  <matthew@visualappliance.com>

	* app/models/earth/directory.rb: Removing unused method

2007-02-26  Matthew Landauer  <matthew@visualappliance.com>

	* app/models/earth/directory.rb: Made method private

2007-02-26  Matthew Landauer  <matthew@visualappliance.com>

	* daemon/daemon_test.rb: In daemon_test check that the cache is
	  complete. Also don't access the internal caching implementation
	  in Directory

2007-02-26  Matthew Landauer  <matthew@visualappliance.com>

	* daemon/daemon_test.rb: Woops, broke daemon_test with my last
	  change. Fixed now.

2007-02-26  Matthew Landauer  <matthew@visualappliance.com>

	* app/controllers/browser_controller.rb,
	  app/models/earth/server.rb: In Server replaced use of
	  size_and_count with size_blocks_and_count

2007-02-26  Matthew Landauer  <matthew@visualappliance.com>

	* app/controllers/browser_controller.rb,
	  app/models/earth/directory.rb, app/models/earth/server.rb,
	  daemon/daemon_test.rb: Replaced use of size_and_count with
	  size_blocks_and_count and made method size, blocks,
	  recursive_file_count use size_blocks_and_count. This way it will
	  also be easier to spot duplicate queries in the SQL logs.

2007-02-26  Matthew Landauer  <matthew@visualappliance.com>

	* app/models/earth/directory.rb: Extracted method and put methods
	  with big SQL queries close together

2007-02-26  Matthew Landauer  <matthew@visualappliance.com>

	* app/models/earth/directory.rb: Replaced use of find(:all) with
	  reload

2007-02-26  Matthew Landauer  <matthew@visualappliance.com>

	* app/models/earth/directory.rb: Got rid of
	  update_cache_after_create method and made cache_enabled apply to
	  both updating and creating of caches

2007-02-26  Matthew Landauer  <matthew@visualappliance.com>

	* app/models/earth/directory.rb: Use @@cache_enabled instead of
	  @@cache_disabled

2007-02-26  Matthew Landauer  <matthew@visualappliance.com>

	* app/models/earth/directory.rb: Don't need
	  update_cache_before_update because nothing changes in
	  cached_sizes.find(:all)

2007-02-26  Matthew Landauer  <matthew@visualappliance.com>

	* app/models/earth/directory.rb: Extracted method

2007-02-24  Julian Scheid  <julians@rsp.com.au>

2007-02-24  Julian Scheid  <julians@rsp.com.au>

	* vendor/plugins/faster_nested_set/lib/faster_nested_set.rb: Change

2007-02-24  Julian Scheid  <julians@rsp.com.au>

	* app/views/layouts/application.rhtml,

	* app/models/earth/directory.rb,
	  vendor/plugins/faster_nested_set/lib/faster_nested_set.rb:
	  Optimize faster_nested_set.ancestors by fetching all ancestors
	  with a single query; remove Directory.self_and_ancestors_up_to,
	  and introduce a generic method self_and_ancestors_up_to in
	  faster_nested_set

2007-02-24  Julian Scheid  <julians@rsp.com.au>

	* app/controllers/graph_controller.rb: Improved size queries for
	  leaf-level directories; minor refactorings and improved in-line
	  code documentation; this is meant to address the performance
	  problem described in #138

2007-02-23  Matthew Landauer  <matthew@visualappliance.com>

	* release/tarball.rb: Simple script to create tarball from tagged

	  setting protocol option

2007-02-22  Julian Scheid  <julians@rsp.com.au>

	* daemon/file_monitor.rb: Do not skip adding directories when doing
	  the initial scan for files; this fixes a bug which would lead to
	  new directories not being added to the database in some
	  situations

2007-02-22  Julian Scheid  <julians@rsp.com.au>

	* config/environment.rb, daemon/daemon_test.rb,
	  daemon/file_monitor.rb: Add timestamp with microsecond precision
	  to log output; add log output to daemon_test; more detailed log
	  output for file_monitor

2007-02-21  Bruno Mattarollo  <bruno.mattarollo@rsp.com.au>

	* app/models/user.rb: Setting the LDAP protocol to v3 as our LDAP
	  servers bark if you try to connect with a legacy protocol ...
	  ARGH

2007-02-21  Julian Scheid  <julians@rsp.com.au>

	* app/views/layouts/servers.rhtml, public/stylesheets/base.css,
	  public/stylesheets/servers.css: Added Earth logo to application
	  and administration layout

2007-02-21  Julian Scheid  <julians@rsp.com.au>

	* daemon/file_monitor.rb, test/fixtures/cached_sizes.yml: In
	  file_monitor, only create cache entries if they don't already
	  exist; remove fixtures for cached_sizes as they are created
	  implicitly when the directories are created.

2007-02-21  Julian Scheid  <julians@rsp.com.au>

	* app/models/earth/directory.rb,
	  db/migrate/049_unique_cached_sizes_directory_filter.rb: Reload
	  cached sizes on directory after cached size creation; add
	  uniqueness constraint on cached_sizes table; fixes #129

2007-02-21  Julian Scheid  <julians@rsp.com.au>

	* daemon/file_monitor.rb: In file_monitor, make sure that in-memory
	  directory nodes always have cached_sizes associated with them.

2007-02-20  Bruno Mattarollo  <bruno.mattarollo@rsp.com.au>

	* public/images/earth_logo_small.png: Added the Earth logo (v0.1)
	  
	  Credit to this goes to Andrew Francois <andrew.francois at uts
	  edu au>

2007-02-20  Matthew Landauer  <matthew@visualappliance.com>

	* test/test_helper.rb, test/unit/directory_test.rb,
	  test/unit/file_monitor_test.rb: Renamed methods to be a little
	  clearer

2007-02-20  Matthew Landauer  <matthew@visualappliance.com>

	* test/test_helper.rb: Extracted method

2007-02-20  Matthew Landauer  <matthew@visualappliance.com>

	* test/test_helper.rb: Small code reorganisation

2007-02-20  Matthew Landauer  <matthew@visualappliance.com>

	* test/test_helper.rb: Small fix of end in wrong place

2007-02-20  Matthew Landauer  <matthew@visualappliance.com>

	* lib/test_unit_improvements.rb, test/test_helper.rb,
	  test/unit/file_monitor_test.rb: Moved contents of
	  test_unit_improvements to test_helper which is the more
	  'standard' location

2007-02-20  Matthew Landauer  <matthew@visualappliance.com>

	* config/database.yml: Added allow_concurrency: true to the posgres
	  setup which should now use asynchronous calls for the calls to
	  the db. Maybe that will fix the problem we've been seeing?

2007-02-20  Matthew Landauer  <matthew@visualappliance.com>

	* daemon/file_monitor.rb: Added logging of times of doing the
	  heartbeat update in the heartbeat thread. Useful for trying to
	  debug possible waiting condition.

2007-02-19  Matthew Landauer  <matthew@visualappliance.com>

	* daemon/file_monitor.rb: Julian's fix for spurious SQL SELECT's
	  that were taking place from the daemon even when nothing was
	  changing.

2007-02-19  Julian Scheid  <julians@rsp.com.au>

	* daemon/README.daemon_test, daemon/daemon_test.rb: Make
	  daemon_test work in and rm_rf a subdirectory of the directory
	  given by the user; this is safer since in case of a user error
	  only that subdirectory will be emptied, not the directory
	  specified. Fixes #128

2007-02-19  Julian Scheid  <julians@rsp.com.au>

	* test/unit/file_monitor_test.rb: Removed all calls to sleep from
	  file_monitor_test, backdating directories instead; fixes #123

2007-02-19  Julian Scheid  <julians@rsp.com.au>

	* daemon/file_monitor.rb, test/unit/file_monitor_test.rb: In
	  FileMonitor.initial_pass_on_new_directory, suppress benchmarking
	  and ETA output if not invoked from FileMonitor.start; update
	  last_update_finish_time from FileMonitor.start instead of
	  FileMonitor.initial_pass_on_new_direectory; use
	  FileMonitor.initial_pass_on_new_directory to scan directories
	  newly discovered in update_non_recursive; reload root directory
	  in test_extensive between iterations; fixes #115

2007-02-19  Matthew Landauer  <matthew@visualappliance.com>

	* app/models/user.rb, test/unit/user_ldap_test.rb: Now can do
	  search by uid (by just entering a number) even when LDAP is
	  configured. Fixes ticket #89

2007-02-19  Julian Scheid  <julians@rsp.com.au>

	* vendor/plugins/faster_nested_set/lib/faster_nested_set.rb,
	  vendor/plugins/faster_nested_set/test/category_test.rb: Fix bug
	  which would introduce an inconsistency when a subtree with more
	  than one node is inserted into an existing tree; avoid problem
	  that only surfaces when using faster_nested_set with trees that
	  do not track the node level

2007-02-19  Matthew Landauer  <matthew@visualappliance.com>

	* db/migrate/048_ensure_only_default_filter.rb: Added migration
	  which ensures that only the default filter * exists in the db. If
	  it doesn't exist it creates it. Fixes ticket #122.

	  Updated to Rails 1.2.2. Fixes ticket #125.

2007-02-19  Matthew Landauer  <matthew@visualappliance.com>

	* app/views/browser/show.rhtml: Shows directory and file sizes with
	  the same scale. Fixes ticket #93.

2007-02-19  Julian Scheid  <julians@rsp.com.au>

	* daemon/file_monitor.rb: Refactored argument passing in
	  file_monitor's update methods; prepared for more efficient
	  indexing of newly discovered directories

2007-02-19  Matthew Landauer  <matthew@visualappliance.com>

	* vendor/plugins/earth_activerecord,
	  vendor/plugins/earth_activerecord/init.rb,

2007-02-16  Julian Scheid  <julians@rsp.com.au>

	* app/controllers/servers_controller.rb,
	  app/models/earth/directory.rb, app/models/earth/file.rb,
	  public/stylesheets/servers.css: In
	  Directory.recursive_directory_count, determine number of children
	  faster by using left and right edge values instead of counting
	  all children; in server_controller, set default file filter so
	  that cache is used; nicer colors for crashed server status in
	  administration overview.

2007-02-16  Julian Scheid  <julians@rsp.com.au>

	* daemon/file_monitor.rb: Remove call to File.exist? for checking
	  existance of a directory; instead, catch ENOENT errors raised by
	  the subsequent File.lstat. This saves one file system operation
	  and prevents errors when a directory is deleted just between
	  calls to File.exist? and File.lstat

2007-02-16  Julian Scheid  <julians@rsp.com.au>

	* test/unit/file_monitor_test.rb: Use larger subdirectory tree for
	  test_remove_nested_directories_performance

2007-02-15  Julian Scheid  <julians@rsp.com.au>

	* app/models/earth/server.rb, daemon/file_monitor.rb,
	  db/migrate/047_add_delete_cascade_to_directories.rb,
	  lib/test_unit_improvements.rb, test/unit/file_monitor_test.rb,
	  vendor/plugins/faster_nested_set/lib/faster_nested_set.rb: In
	  faster_nested_set, delete subtrees with a single delete
	  statement; extension for Test::Unit::TestCase for ensuring that a
	  block executes a given number of SQL DELETE statements; add a
	  test ensuring that having file_monitor delete a directory with
	  sub-directories triggers only a single DELETE statement, fixes
	  #104; make directories delete cascading when the corresponding
	  server is deleted.

2007-02-15  Julian Scheid  <julians@rsp.com.au>

	* app/controllers/browser_controller.rb,
	  app/controllers/graph_controller.rb,
	  app/models/earth/directory.rb,
	  vendor/plugins/faster_nested_set/lib/faster_nested_set.rb:
	  Refactored all parts of the code building SQL queries to use
	  parameter substitution using ? as to prevent SQL injection; fixes
	  #103

2007-02-15  Julian Scheid  <julians@rsp.com.au>

	* daemon/daemon_test.rb: Wait for four update cycles instead of
	  three to deal with timing issues introduced when speeding up the
	  daemon

2007-02-15  Julian Scheid  <julians@rsp.com.au>

	* daemon/daemon_test.rb: Speed up daemon_test by using an
	  update_interval of 1s instead of 2s

2007-02-15  Julian Scheid  <julians@rsp.com.au>

	* test/unit/file_monitor_test.rb: Temporary fix for file_monitor
	  unit tests; the proper fix would backdate files and directories
	  instead of using sleep so that the tests can run faster.

2007-02-15  Julian Scheid  <julians@rsp.com.au>

	* daemon/README.daemon_test, daemon/daemon_test.rb: Only use rand
	  function in between sleeps if --bloodshed option has been
	  specified as otherwise results are not reproducible even without
	  --bloodshed; add and document --replay-iterations option; done
	  away with a global variable; minor tweaks to hardwired parameters

2007-02-13  Julian Scheid  <julians@rsp.com.au>

	* daemon/file_monitor.rb: Do not scan directory if it has been
	  modified less than 1 second ago as to avoid issues with low
	  resolution of file modification times

2007-02-13  Julian Scheid  <julians@rsp.com.au>

	* daemon/README.daemon_test, daemon/daemon_test.rb: Added bloodshed
	  option to daemon_test; added README for daemon_test

2007-02-13  Julian Scheid  <julians@rsp.com.au>

	* daemon/daemon_test.rb: Remove -d/--development switch (always run
	  on test database); use daemon's new -t and -u switches to force
	  running it on the test database and to override any update
	  interval; setup a trap so that test process exits when daemon
	  fails

2007-02-13  Julian Scheid  <julians@rsp.com.au>

	* daemon/earth_daemon.rb, daemon/file_monitor.rb: Add -t/--test
	  switch to daemon for running on test database; add
	  -u/--update-interval option for overriding update interval from
	  database (both needed for daemon_test process)

2007-02-13  Julian Scheid  <julians@rsp.com.au>

	* app/models/earth/cached_size.rb, app/models/earth/directory.rb,
	  daemon/file_monitor.rb: Better solution for avoiding saving stale
	  cache data; removed dead code from directory model

2007-02-13  Julian Scheid  <julians@rsp.com.au>

	* daemon/daemon_test.rb: Added more checks and more mutation
	  operators; mutation operators are now weighted; some code
	  cleanups

2007-02-13  Julian Scheid  <julians@rsp.com.au>

	* test/unit/file_monitor_test.rb: Add test for simultaneous removal
	  of multiple directories and multiple files

2007-02-13  Julian Scheid  <julians@rsp.com.au>

	* daemon/file_monitor.rb: Make sure directory nodes are not
	  associated with stale cache information

2007-02-13  Julian Scheid  <julians@rsp.com.au>

	* daemon/file_monitor.rb: Ignore ENOENT errors that can be occur
	  when Dir.entries is invoked on a directory that has just been
	  deleted

2007-02-13  Julian Scheid  <julians@rsp.com.au>

	* daemon/file_monitor.rb: Decrement remaining_counter after sleep
	  calculation, slightly improving sleep accuracy for small numbers
	  of directories; in contents method, ignore ENOENT errors which
	  can arise when a file is deleted after Dir.entries and before
	  File.lstat is called; small improvements to logging

2007-02-13  Julian Scheid  <julians@rsp.com.au>

	* vendor/plugins/faster_nested_set/lib/faster_nested_set.rb: Bugfix
	  for children_count which was returning stale information from
	  memory

2007-02-13  Julian Scheid  <julians@rsp.com.au>

	* daemon/daemon_test.rb, daemon/file_monitor.rb: Fixed bug in
	  file_monitor when multiple subdirectories or files are deleted in
	  one go; added some logging in file_monitor; improved output and
	  integrity verification in daemon_test

2007-02-12  Julian Scheid  <julians@rsp.com.au>

	* daemon/daemon_test.rb: Initial version of daemon stress testing
	  tool

2007-02-12  Julian Scheid  <julians@rsp.com.au>

	* daemon/file_monitor.rb: Set last_update_finish_time for a server
	  to nil when it is cleared out; for the initial phase, only set
	  last_update_finish_time after the initial phase has completed.

2007-02-12  Matthew Landauer  <matthew@visualappliance.com>

	* app/models/earth/directory.rb: Caching for size and blocks added
	  in similar way with alias_method_chain

2007-02-12  Matthew Landauer  <matthew@visualappliance.com>

	* app/models/earth/directory.rb: Small refactoring. Rename methods.
	  Using alias_method_chain to use simple naming convention for
	  methods that use caching

2007-02-12  Julian Scheid  <julians@rsp.com.au>

	* app/models/earth/directory.rb: Use cache for counting files in
	  directory if possible

2007-02-12  Matthew Landauer  <matthew@visualappliance.com>

	* app/views/browser/_breadcrumb_and_filter.rhtml: Now always
	  displays hide/show empty directories but doesn't link from it
	  when inactive. Fixes ticket #92.

2007-02-12  Matthew Landauer  <matthew@visualappliance.com>

	* app/controllers/browser_controller.rb,
	  app/models/earth/server.rb: Updated controller for top level
	  servers view so that it uses more efficient size_and_count. Also
	  created method on Server model.

	* app/models/earth/server.rb: Make File refer not to Earth::File

2007-02-09  Matthew Landauer  <matthew@visualappliance.com>

	* config/database.yml: Make default db config point development db

	  app/views/servers/show.rhtml, config/database.yml,
	  config/earth-webapp.yml, config/routes.rb,
	  public/stylesheets/servers.css: More information and improved
	  layout in administration view; use FQDN instead of host name for
	  name column in servers table; better routing for administration
	  view

2007-02-09  Julian Scheid  <julians@rsp.com.au>

	  daemon/file_monitor.rb, public/images/icon_server.png,
	  public/stylesheets/base.css, public/stylesheets/servers.css:
	  Changed server icon to gnome-system.png (from Wiki commons,
	  GPLed); added stylesheet for administration view; added link to
	  project home page (fixes #108); added link in normal view to
	  administration view; reload server data before setting
	  daemon_version to nil when daemon exits, thus not resetting other
	  server data to old values

2007-02-09  Julian Scheid  <julians@rsp.com.au>

	* db/migrate/046_unique_server_name.rb: Add unique index on server

	  base class

2007-02-08  Matthew Landauer  <matthew@visualappliance.com>

	* app/helpers/application_helper.rb: Undoing accidental commit

2007-02-08  Matthew Landauer  <matthew@visualappliance.com>

	* app/helpers/application_helper.rb, daemon/earth_daemon.rb,
	  daemon/file_monitor.rb: Added suppor for multiple watch
	  directories to the daemon. **However** faster nested set is being
	  used with a scope condition which will result in inconsistent lft
	  and rgt values so, basically, don't use this feature YET

2007-02-08  Julian Scheid  <julians@rsp.com.au>

	* app/models/earth/directory.rb, daemon/file_monitor.rb,

	* vendor/plugins/faster_nested_set/lib/faster_nested_set.rb,
	  vendor/plugins/faster_nested_set/test/category_test.rb: Have
	  children_count override the corresponding method defined by
	  ActiveRecord's deprecated_association; make children_count not
	  use possibly stale left and right values from memory; have
	  overriding update method call before_update and after_update
	  hooks

2007-02-08  Matthew Landauer  <matthew@visualappliance.com>

	* daemon/earth_daemon.rb, daemon/file_monitor.rb,
	  test/unit/file_monitor_test.rb: Getting ready to allow multiple

2007-02-07  Matthew Landauer  <matthew@visualappliance.com>

	* test/unit/file_monitor_test.rb: Added cleanup of test directory
	  test_data_2

2007-02-07  Matthew Landauer  <matthew@visualappliance.com>

	* daemon/file_monitor.rb: Refactoring FileMonitor... (Not very good
	  with words today)

2007-02-07  Julian Scheid  <julians@rsp.com.au>

	* db/migrate/043_fix_directories_path_index.rb,
	  db/migrate/044_fix_files_path_index.rb: Make indexes of file and
	  directory paths less narrow; fixes #112

2007-02-02  Matthew Landauer  <matthew@visualappliance.com>

	* daemon/earth_daemon.rb, daemon/file_monitor.rb,
	  test/unit/file_monitor_test.rb: Undo the changes from my last
	  commit because I have no brain (It's Friday evening and I've had
	  some beer).

2007-02-02  Matthew Landauer  <matthew@visualappliance.com>

	* daemon/earth_daemon.rb, daemon/file_monitor.rb,
	  test/unit/file_monitor_test.rb: Now run on FileMonitor.update on
	  a server rather than just a single directory

2007-02-02  Matthew Landauer  <matthew@visualappliance.com>

	* daemon/file_monitor.rb: Inlined method

2007-02-02  Bruno Mattarollo  <bruno.mattarollo@rsp.com.au>

	* config/database.yml: Tiny little change (also using this to test
	  post-commit hooks
	  on SVN)

2007-02-02  Bruno Mattarollo  <bruno.mattarollo@rsp.com.au>

	* config/database.yml: Changing the references from MySQL to
	  PostgreSQL to reflect
	  the RDBMS we are using.

2007-02-02  Matthew Landauer  <matthew@visualappliance.com>

	* daemon/earth_daemon.rb, daemon/file_monitor.rb: Extracted method
	  for starting file monitor on arbitrary directory

2007-02-02  Bruno Mattarollo  <bruno.mattarollo@rsp.com.au>

	* test_file: Last test, promise

2007-02-02  Bruno Mattarollo  <bruno.mattarollo@rsp.com.au>

	* test_file: Sorry, yet another test :(

2007-02-02  Matthew Landauer  <matthew@visualappliance.com>

	* daemon/earth_daemon.rb, daemon/file_monitor.rb: Now have to run
	  --clear explicitly to clear out the database. The daemon always
	  expects a path now on startup. If
	  it's the same as before it will load the startup data from the
	  database. If there's no data in the database it
	  will start indexing the new directory. Otherwise it will error,
	  asking the use to run with --clear.

2007-02-02  Bruno Mattarollo  <bruno.mattarollo@rsp.com.au>

	  graph_helper; improved CSS stylesheet; added count column to
	  cached_sizes table; added path column to files table; replaced

	  count rather than the directory count

2007-01-22  Matthew Landauer  <matthew@visualappliance.com>

	* daemon/file_monitor.rb, test/unit/directory_test.rb: The daemon
	  should hog a lot less memory when it is running now as the
	  file objects should not be cached. Also, commented out the
	  "VACUUM" as
	  it's probably more elegant to do this on the database itself with
	  the
	  autovacuum functionality?

2007-01-22  Matthew Landauer  <matthew@visualappliance.com>

2007-01-12  Matthew Landauer  <matthew@visualappliance.com>

	* app/models/user.rb: In the browser if the uid is not found in
	  LDAP it will just display the uid number (just like the unix "ls"
	  does). Fixes
	  ticket #87.

2007-01-12  Matthew Landauer  <matthew@visualappliance.com>

	* config/environments/development.rb: Revert accidental change to

2007-01-12  Matthew Landauer  <matthew@visualappliance.com>

	* app/models/user.rb, test/functional/browser_controller_test.rb:
	  Bad me. I broke the unit tests. Bad Matthew. Bad Matthew!

2007-01-12  Matthew Landauer  <matthew@visualappliance.com>

	* config/routes.rb: By changing the default path /browser/show we
	  can get rid of the really ugly hack of a route just for the AJAX
	  stuff

2007-01-12  Bruno Mattarollo  <bruno.mattarollo@rsp.com.au>

	* public/stylesheets/base.css: Modified the z-index of the graph
	  and the auto_complete so that the user list from the
	  auto_complete appears in front of the graph.

2007-01-12  Matthew Landauer  <matthew@visualappliance.com>

	* app/controllers/browser_controller.rb, config/earth.yml: If LDAP
	  isn't configured won't do AJAX user name lookup

2007-01-12  Matthew Landauer  <matthew@visualappliance.com>

	* app/controllers/browser_controller.rb, app/models/user.rb,
	  app/views/browser/show.rhtml, config/earth.yml, config/routes.rb:
	  First (really ugly and nasty) version of AJAX user name lookup
	  via LDAP

2007-01-11  Matthew Landauer  <matthew@visualappliance.com>

	* config/earth.yml: LDAP still disabled but...

2007-01-11  Matthew Landauer  <matthew@visualappliance.com>

2007-01-11  Matthew Landauer  <matthew@visualappliance.com>

	* app/controllers/browser_controller.rb,

2007-01-11  Matthew Landauer  <matthew@visualappliance.com>

	* app/models/user.rb, test/unit/user_test.rb: Added find_all for

2007-01-11  Matthew Landauer  <matthew@visualappliance.com>

2007-01-11  Matthew Landauer  <matthew@visualappliance.com>

	* app/models/earth/file.rb, app/models/ownership.rb,
	  app/views/files/results.rhtml, config/earth.yml,
	  test/unit/ownership_test.rb: Removed use of group ownership for

2007-01-11  Matthew Landauer  <matthew@visualappliance.com>

	* app/controllers/browser_controller.rb,
	  app/views/browser/show.rhtml: Added filter by user id

	* app/controllers/browser_controller.rb,
	  app/models/earth/directory.rb, app/models/earth/server.rb: Now
	  doing the sum and count over File which means that the with_scope
	  is over File as well now

2007-01-11  Matthew Landauer  <matthew@visualappliance.com>

	* app/controllers/browser_controller.rb,
	  app/models/earth/directory.rb, app/models/earth/server.rb:

	  app/views/browser/show.rhtml, app/views/browser/show.rxml,
	  test/functional/browser_controller_test.rb,
	  test/unit/directory_test.rb: Remove methods for finding the
	  non-recursive size of a directory (because it wasn't being used
	  other than in the tests)
	  and renamed the methods recursive_size to size which is shorter!

2007-01-10  Matthew Landauer  <matthew@visualappliance.com>

	* app/controllers/browser_controller.rb: Removed unused code

2007-01-10  Bruno Mattarollo  <bruno.mattarollo@rsp.com.au>

	* app/views/browser/show.rhtml, public/stylesheets/base.css: *
	  Changed the view to float the filter form to the right
	  * Reduced the font-size of the Show/Hide link

2007-01-10  Matthew Landauer  <matthew@visualappliance.com>

	* app/controllers/browser_controller.rb,
	  app/models/earth/directory.rb, app/models/earth/server.rb,
	  app/views/browser/show.rhtml: Really hacky and horrible
	  implementation of filtering by filename.

2007-01-10  Matthew Landauer  <matthew@visualappliance.com>

	* app/views/browser/show.rhtml: Correctly links to the same server
	  and directory

2007-01-10  Matthew Landauer  <matthew@visualappliance.com>

	* app/controllers/browser_controller.rb,
	  app/views/browser/show.rhtml: Added "Filter by filename" field
	  that currently doesn't do anything

2007-01-10  Matthew Landauer  <matthew@visualappliance.com>

	* app/controllers/browser_controller.rb,
	  test/functional/browser_controller_test.rb: Filtering out empty
	  directories and servers. Implements ticket #79.

2007-01-10  Matthew Landauer  <matthew@visualappliance.com>

	* app/models/earth/directory.rb, app/models/earth/server.rb,
	  test/unit/directory_test.rb, test/unit/server_test.rb: Added
	  method has_files? to Server and Directory which figures out
	  whether there are any files anywhere below the current
	  server or directory.

2007-01-10  Matthew Landauer  <matthew@visualappliance.com>

	* app/controllers/browser_controller.rb,
	  app/helpers/application_helper.rb, app/views/browser/show.rhtml:
	  In the GUI added option for hiding/showing empty directories and
	  servers. The state is correctly maintained as the user
	  clicks around. However, it doesn't actually do anything yet.

2007-01-09  Matthew Landauer  <matthew@visualappliance.com>

	* app/controllers/browser_controller.rb: Logic of controller is
	  clearer now

2007-01-09  Matthew Landauer  <matthew@visualappliance.com>

	* app/views/files/results.rhtml: Oops. fixed file link in search
	  results

2007-01-09  Matthew Landauer  <matthew@visualappliance.com>

	  app/views/browser/show.rhtml, app/views/browser/show.rxml,
	  test/functional/browser_controller_test.rb: Don't need to
	  calculate the recursive_size in the browser controller anymore as
	  we are now caching the values in the model

2007-01-09  Matthew Landauer  <matthew@visualappliance.com>

	* config/routes.rb, test/functional/browser_controller_test.rb: The
	  routes will now correctly handle server names without any dots in
	  them

2007-01-09  Matthew Landauer  <matthew@visualappliance.com>

	* app/controllers/browser_controller.rb: If trying to browse to a
	  non-existent server or directory will now redirect to a sensible
	  page

2007-01-09  Matthew Landauer  <matthew@visualappliance.com>

	* app/views/browser/show.rhtml: Added "Modified" and "User" to
	  information shown for files in browser

2007-01-09  Matthew Landauer  <matthew@visualappliance.com>

	* app/views/layouts/application.rhtml: Fixed top tab by changing
	  the name from "servers" to "browser"

2007-01-09  Matthew Landauer  <matthew@visualappliance.com>

	* app/helpers/application_helper.rb, app/views/browser/show.rhtml:
	  link_to's are now shortened by things being in the same
	  controller

	  and servers controller with one controller called "browser". This
	  simplifies things (hopefully)

2007-01-09  Matthew Landauer  <matthew@visualappliance.com>

	* app/helpers/application_helper.rb,
	  app/views/directories/show.rhtml, app/views/servers/list.rhtml,
	  app/views/servers/show.rhtml: Now using the same helper function
	  for creating the breadcrumbs across three views

2007-01-09  Matthew Landauer  <matthew@visualappliance.com>

	* app/controllers/servers_controller.rb, config/routes.rb,
	  test/functional/directories_controller_test.rb,
	  test/functional/servers_controller_test.rb: Hiding server and
	  directories implementation behind the URL starting with 'browser'

	  app/views/shared/_browser.rhtml, config/routes.rb,
	  test/functional/directories_controller_test.rb,
	  test/functional/servers_controller_test.rb: Now have pretty URL's
	  for navigation. However, because the routing globbing is not very
	  flexible, the code is not as
	  DRY as it should be.

2007-01-09  Matthew Landauer  <matthew@visualappliance.com>

	* app/controllers/servers_controller.rb,
	  app/helpers/application_helper.rb,
	  app/views/directories/show.rhtml, app/views/files/results.rhtml,
	  app/views/shared/_browser.rhtml: All directory navigation is now
	  with URL's that have the server name and path in them. Partially
	  resolves ticket #60.

2007-01-08  Matthew Landauer  <matthew@visualappliance.com>

	* app/controllers/files_controller.rb: Fixed bug with broken search

2007-01-08  Matthew Landauer  <matthew@visualappliance.com>

	* app/views/files/results.rhtml: Fixed link (broken because of
	  rename of action from size to show)

2007-01-08  Matthew Landauer  <matthew@visualappliance.com>

	* app/views/directories/show.rhtml, app/views/servers/list.rhtml,

	  app/views/servers/list.rhtml, app/views/servers/show.rhtml,

	  app/helpers/directories_helper.rb, app/views/servers/list.rhtml,
	  app/views/servers/show.rhtml,

2007-01-08  Matthew Landauer  <matthew@visualappliance.com>

	* app/views/directories/size.rhtml: Making for better breadcrumbs

2007-01-08  Matthew Landauer  <matthew@visualappliance.com>

	* app/models/earth/directory.rb,
	  app/models/nested_set_improvements.rb, daemon/file_monitor.rb:
	  path is cached and creating of directory now in a transaction

2007-01-08  Matthew Landauer  <matthew@visualappliance.com>

	* daemon/file_monitor.rb: Putting directory benchmark back in

2007-01-08  Matthew Landauer  <matthew@visualappliance.com>

	* app/models/earth/directory.rb, test/unit/directory_test.rb: Can
	  set the path directly for a particular directory object. Really
	  ugly hack

2007-01-08  Matthew Landauer  <matthew@visualappliance.com>

	* app/models/earth/directory.rb, daemon/file_monitor.rb,
	  test/unit/directory_test.rb: Now have to explicitly set server_id
	  when creating a directory

2007-01-08  Matthew Landauer  <matthew@visualappliance.com>

	* app/models/earth/directory.rb,
	  app/models/nested_set_improvements.rb: Extracted method child_add
	  which adds a preexisting node as a child of the current node

2007-01-07  Bruno Mattarollo  <bruno.mattarollo@rsp.com.au>

	* app/views/directories/size.rhtml, public/stylesheets/base.css: *
	  Quickly address bug #76. Removed the unnecessary links from the
	  browser.

2007-01-07  Matthew Landauer  <matthew@visualappliance.com>

	* app/models/earth/directory.rb,
	  db/migrate/029_remove_path_column_again.rb,
	  test/fixtures/directories.yml: Removed a premature optimisation.
	  Removed the path column from the directories table of the
	  database

2007-01-07  Matthew Landauer  <matthew@visualappliance.com>

	* app/models/earth/directory.rb: Overriding path and find_by_path
	  with implementation that doesn't use path field in the database.
	  Next we remove
	  the path field so that things are more normalised

2007-01-07  Matthew Landauer  <matthew@visualappliance.com>

	* test/unit/directory_test.rb: Added test for
	  Earth::Directory.find_by_path

2007-01-03  Matthew Landauer  <matthew@visualappliance.com>

	* app/models/earth/directory.rb: By adding scope to the nested set,
	  we can restrict INSERTS on a tree to only UPDATING directories on
	  the same server.
	  This should improve performance considerably when multiple
	  servers are doing inserts.
	  
	  This also might resolve ticket #62, though this has to be
	  verified with Postgres as well as the bug was only reported
	  for MySQL.

2007-01-03  Matthew Landauer  <matthew@visualappliance.com>

	* config/database.yml: Moving default database to be Postgres.
	  Looks like postgres is the way to go with better concurrency
	  handling than MySQL.
	  Not completely born out by observation yet though circumstantial
	  evidence (and reading of docs) is pointing in that
	  direction.

2007-01-03  Matthew Landauer  <matthew@visualappliance.com>

	* test/unit/directory_test.rb: Setting of allow_concurrency is now
	  done is setup and teardown methods

2006-12-31  Bruno Mattarollo  <bruno.mattarollo@rsp.com.au>

	* app/controllers/files_controller.rb,
	  app/views/files/results.rhtml,
	  test/functional/files_controller_test.rb: * Changed the
	  functional test from the files_controller to reflect the change
	  in the way we use the "form_for" which is (according to the docs)
	  the right one we should be using
	  * Changed the files controller to remove the query in the "find"
	  method and put all in the results one (sounds slightly counter
	  intuitive, maybe in the next commit I will rename the view to
	  find and put one call index which is the current find)
	  * Changed human_size to number_to_human_size as recommended by
	  the warnings I got from the test suite.

2006-12-31  Bruno Mattarollo  <bruno.mattarollo@rsp.com.au>

	* app/views/files/results.rhtml: Was getting a warning when running
	  the test suite that human_size should be parentesized.
	  "parenthesize argument(s) for future version".

2006-12-31  Bruno Mattarollo  <bruno.mattarollo@rsp.com.au>

	* app/views/directories/size.rhtml, app/views/files/results.rhtml,
	  public/stylesheets/base.css: * Added the right classes to the
	  table cells in the directories view
	  * Added the right classes and modified the view to work with the
	  new UI on the results view
	  * Linked the file name from the results of a search to the file
	  browser (directories/size/ID). When you hover over a file name it
	  displays the PATH where that file is and when you click on the
	  file name (after a search) it will take you to the file browser
	  where that file lives (since we have the ID of the directory from
	  file.directory.id)

	* app/views/directories/size.rhtml, public/images/icon_file.png,

	  Changed the UI files to make their background transparent.
	  * Used the Collaboa CSS for the file browser.

2006-12-31  Bruno Mattarollo  <bruno.mattarollo@rsp.com.au>

	* public/images/icon_file.png, public/images/icon_folder.png:

	  r13277@duck: matthewl | 2006-12-31 10:52:04 +1100
	  Alternative solution to the invalid recursive_size. Instead of
	  hiding the
	  find and recursive_size in a transaction, recursive_size now only
	  uses the
	  id of the current object and so will not be invalidated by other
	  tree
	  operations

	  Getting some of the tests more ready to be used with Postgres
	  rather than
	  Mysql. This involves fixing the order that some results are
	  returned by
	  doing a sort rather than depending on an implementation order.

	  * Removed the DIV called MainFrame from all the files were it was
	  used, as we don't need it anymore
	  * Added another overloaded function from the RedHill foreign keys
	  to the foreign_key_constraint_improvements.rb library as it
	  wasn't generating the "schema.rb" file correctly with the
	  constraint name
	  * Added two migrations to change the filename from text to string
	  so that we can create an index and make the searches based on
	  name faster. In theory, we should be able to handle most
	  operating systems with a filename of 255 characters (NOTE: this
	  might need a bit more research to confirm that this is the case)
	  * Changes in the UI for the files views
	  * Simplified the files controller

2006-12-21  Bruno Mattarollo  <bruno.mattarollo@rsp.com.au>

2006-12-13  Bruno Mattarollo  <bruno.mattarollo@rsp.com.au>

	* app/views/directories/size.rhtml, public/stylesheets/base.css:
	  Replaced the button for the "Save as CSV" with an icon and
	  modified the CSS to remove the border that's placed by default
	  around images that are hyperlinks.

2006-12-13  Matthew Landauer  <matthew@visualappliance.com>

	* app/views/file_info/find.rhtml, app/views/servers/list.rhtml,
	  test/unit/posix_file_monitor_test.rb, test/unit/server_test.rb,
	  test/unit/snapshot_test.rb: Got rid of deprecated warnings (for
	  Rails 2.0) when running tests

2006-12-13  Bruno Mattarollo  <bruno.mattarollo@rsp.com.au>

	* public/images/excel.png: Added a small icon that we can use for
	  "save as CSV"

2006-12-13  Matthew Landauer  <matthew@visualappliance.com>

	* config/environment.rb: Updated to Rails 1.2 RC 1

2006-12-13  Bruno Mattarollo  <bruno.mattarollo@rsp.com.au>

	* public/stylesheets/base.css: Removed the "overflow: hidden" from
	  the Container ID as it's hiding the scroll bars (when you have
	  very long paths on a result set in /file_info/ it's a problem).

2006-12-13  Kenji Oates  <kenji.oates@rsp.com.au>

	* app/controllers/directories_controller.rb,
	  app/views/directories/size.rhtml: Added export to CSV, VERY ugly

2006-12-13  Bruno Mattarollo  <bruno.mattarollo@rsp.com.au>

	* app/views/directories/size.rhtml, public/stylesheets/base.css: We
	  now use different colours for the CSS bars that represent the
	  relative size of the directories and the files.

2006-12-13  Kenji Oates  <kenji.oates@rsp.com.au>

	* test/unit/directory_test.rb: Fix for server not being set on

2006-12-12  Matthew Landauer  <matthew@visualappliance.com>

	* app/models/directory.rb, db/migrate/024_make_path_column_big.rb:
	  Now directory will use the path that is set in the db. Also
	  increased the size of the path in the db so it won't be
	  arbitrarily chopped off.

2006-12-12  Matthew Landauer  <matthew@visualappliance.com>

	* daemon/snapshot.rb: Might have lazy loading of file information
	  working now

2006-12-12  Matthew Landauer  <matthew@visualappliance.com>

	  much lighter so that it doesn't interfere with the UI

2006-12-12  Bruno Mattarollo  <bruno.mattarollo@rsp.com.au>

	* app/views/directories/size.rhtml,
	  app/views/layouts/application.rhtml,
	  app/views/servers/list.rhtml, public/stylesheets/base.css: Layout
	  Changes:
	  
	  * Changed the CSS
	  * Modified the tables so that they use cellpadding, cellspacing
	  of 0 and we control the spacing from within the CSS
	  * Added a nice alternating class to the table rows

2006-12-12  Matthew Landauer  <matthew@visualappliance.com>

	* config/earth.yml, daemon/snapshot.rb: Trying to get Snapshot into

	  daemon/snapshot.rb, test/unit/file_database_updater_test.rb,
	  test/unit/posix_file_monitor_test.rb, test/unit/snapshot_test.rb:
	  Cleaned away code that is now unused (from the last commit)

2006-12-12  Matthew Landauer  <matthew@visualappliance.com>

	* daemon/file_database_updater.rb, daemon/posix_file_monitor.rb,
	  daemon/snapshot.rb, test/unit/file_database_updater_test.rb,
	  test/unit/posix_file_monitor_test.rb, test/unit/snapshot_test.rb:
	  In the process of inlining active record updates (which are now
	  being done in the Snapshot class)

2006-12-12  Matthew Landauer  <matthew@visualappliance.com>

	* daemon/posix_file_monitor.rb: On restarting the daemon, it now
	  gets all the directory information with a single database query

2006-12-12  Matthew Landauer  <matthew@visualappliance.com>

	  the application it will take you to the "servers" controller

2006-12-12  Bruno Mattarollo  <bruno.mattarollo@rsp.com.au>

	* app/views/directories/size.rhtml, public/stylesheets/base.css:

	  anymore as css bar charts seem to
	  be working fine.

2006-12-12  Bruno Mattarollo  <bruno.mattarollo@rsp.com.au>

	* app/views/layouts/application.rhtml: Continued with the
	  modifications to the structure of the XHTML page.
