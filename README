Earth - it's really, really big

Earth allows you to find files across a large network of machines and track
disk usage in real time. It consists of a daemon that indexes filesystems in
real time and reports all the changes back to a central database. This can then
be queried through a simple, yet powerful, web interface. Think of it like
Spotlight or Beagle but operating system independent with a central database
for multiple machines with a web application that allows novel ways of
exploring your data.

Earth is initially focused on managing the explosion of data that occurs in
digital visual effects work.
